## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

Arath is a very complex, self-assured, humorous and hedonistic druid who cares for little else beyond himself and his love for nature. He loves the human form, both male and female, and isn't afraid to be direct about what he wants -- though he's not always successful in gettin git, much to his chagrin. He has a passionate hate for aberrations, the undead and anything else that falls beyond the natural scheme of things, and he has some rather complex and occasionally contradictory beliefs.

Arath includes both friendship and romance dialogues throughout SoA & TOB.

Arath features:

  - an opinionated, quirky new Druid NPC
  - many banters with BioWare NPCs (3+ throughout SoA/ToB)
  - many talks on a variety of in-game plots and ideas
  - commentary throughout the game on the PC's quest
  - joins during the slaver line of quests in Chapter 2
  - a new quest in late SoA
  - a unique romance spanning SoA and ToB
  - an extensive friendship with any PC not romancing him
  - original portrait by Lady Lesatho
  - original music by theacefes
